# Contributing

This file is describing our code style and some other documentation about contributions. You must read it before your
first contribution.

Also note that this all is just recommendations, you can use anything in some cases, if it will be better than solution
that we propose here. However, we will prefer these recommendations when we will review your contribution.

## Language

All contributions, all code, all comments, all commits and everything else **must** be in English. 

## `make test`

This "magic" command collects almost all of our CI. If you're on Windows, try [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org) to
run `make`.

Also, because of conflict between `pytest-testmon` and `pytest-cov` we use option `--no-cov` in `pytest`, so in this
way we give prioritize to `pytest-testmon`. If you want to generate a report with `pytest-cov`, use `make test ci=1`.

## `pre-commit`

Furthermore, you can bind `make test` (plus some additional useful checks) to run on every commit, so you will always
sure that CI will never fail. Just run `pre-commit install`.

## Code Style

We use `black` for almost all style control. We're also trying to use formatters instead of linters, where it is
possible.

Furthermore, we also have some rules that `black` doesn't cover. It includes:

### Imports

We have `isort` and `pycln` for imports control. The first used for sorting imports, and second, to remove unused
imports. All other rules are not covered by linters/formatters etc. You should check those yourself.

You should use `import module` and `from package import module` whenever it's possible, but sometimes
`from module import ...` way is more useful. For example:

```py
from dataclasses import dataclass
```

If you're using only one variable from a module, and it's readable without its parent name, you should use
`from module import ...`. But if you're using many variables from module, better would be
`import module`/`from package import module`:

```py
from functools import cached_property
```

You maybe notice that `import module` and `from package import module` are written with `/`, this is because you must
use first one, if no package exist. But if there is a package - you must use `from package import module`. Look at
these examples:

```py
import os
from my_project import config
from my_project import models
```

Notice that there aren't any relative imports, you can't use it here. However, you can use `as`.

Also, you must specify `__all__` variable in all `__init__.py` files with any code (not one docstring). Reason of this
limitation is that `pycln` and docs can't know exactly, do you want to add imports as alias, or this import is for using
in code which in this file. `pycln` will ignore these imports, and docs will duplicate documentation for anything that
you will import.

### Docstrings

We're using `flake8` for checking docstrings presence and their quality. They later in API documentation. You must write
docstrings everywhere, except `__init__` methods (not the same as `__init__.py` files) because those will not go to
documentation.

I also recommend reading [Google styleguide about docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#s3.8-comments-and-docstrings)
because we're using Google style in docstrings.

#### Markup

Because of Sphinx's limitations, we must use ReST markup in docstrings. This allows us to use cross-references to other
functions or even projects.

Read more about [ReST markup](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html)
and [Sphinx's cross-references](https://docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/guides/cross-referencing-with-sphinx.html).

#### `__init__.py` docstrings

They describe a package (folder) with modules (`.py` files).

#### Module, function, class, method based docstrings

It is a short description of an item. They must follow
[Google styleguide about docstrings](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html#s3.8-comments-and-docstrings).

#### Variable-based docstrings 

They must follow in format:

```py
some_variable = "abc"
"""This ``some`` variable used in :class:`.SomeClass`."""
```

This applies for the module level, and class attributes in
[dataclasses](https://docs.python.org/3/library/dataclasses.html)/classes generated by [attrs](https://pypi.org/project/attrs/).
This won't work in `__init__` methods because they don't actually go to documentation. Attributes should be documented
in class-based docstring, in `Attributes` section.

At now, linter doesn't detect them. Better sometimes check that all in API documentation actually documented.

## `pyproject.toml`

In this file, we configure **only** `poetry` (except for `black`, it supports only `pyproject.toml` file for
configuration).

### Groups

Since `poetry` 1.2 a new feature appeared - groups. It allows downloading only those groups of packages, which you will
need. We have four groups - `make`, `tests`, `docs` and `github_hooks`. Every of them answers about their function with
name.

- `make`: All required dependencies for [make test](#make-test).
- `tests`: All required dependencies for tests.
- `docs`: All required dependencies for building documentation.
- `github_hooks`: All required dependencies for GitHub hooks.

Please see [Managing dependencies in poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/managing-dependencies/).

### Versions

All versions must follow in format `X.Y.z` (absolute version) or (`~X.Y`). Last one will compile in `>=X.Y.0,<X.Y+1.0`.
So for example we have last version for abstract dependency `1.2.3`, we specify its version to `~1.2`, so it will
compile to `>=1.2.0,<1.3.0` (any patch version for `1.2` is accepted, but not `1.3`+). If `1.3.0` will be released -
dependabot will create PR for it.

Read more [about Semantic Versions](https://semver.org/) and [Dependency specification in poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/master/dependency-specification/).

## Translations

If you don't know languages which we support - left translation on us.

To update `.po` files run `make translate`, after that, you can edit translations in `.po` files, which can be found as
`locales/<language's tag>/LC_MESSAGES/messages.po` or `locale/<language's tag>/LC_MESSAGES/` in docs. After editing, for
compilation, you can run one more time `make translate` (or `make html` in docs).

To add new language, use `pybabel init -i locales/base.pot -l <language's tag> -d locales` or
`sphinx-intl update -l <language's tag>` for docs.

P.S. Language's tag it is short name of this language, example `en` or `en_EN`. A full list of supported languages can
be found with `pybabel --list-locales`.

## Documentation

We use Sphinx for documentation and [docstrings](#docstrings) for API documentation. At now, there is no actual styles
here, except `doc8`.

## Other Help

You can contribute by spreading a word about this library. It would also be a huge contribution to write a short article
on how you are using this project. You can also share your best practices with us.
